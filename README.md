# API Weather Dashboard

**Objective: Create a dynamic weather dashboard that takes in the user's input, utilizes moment.js, local storage, and the Open Weather API to accomplish the following requirements:**

1. User inputs the city, upon click of the search button, the site displays the current weather and 5-day forecast for that city, utilizing AJAX calls to the Open Weather API.
2. When a new city is searched, it is added to the list of past cities searched. These are stored into localStorage and persist upon refresh.
3. If the user clicks on one of the past cities searched, that city's weather and 5-day forecast will be re-rendered.
4. All forecasts will display the corresponding weather icon.
5. The current forecast will display the UV index, with a box around it whose color corresponds to whether the UV index is low (green), moderate (yellow), or high (red).
6. Upon refresh, the current and 5-day forecast of the last city searched will persist.
